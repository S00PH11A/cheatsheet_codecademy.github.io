Overview Welcome to the "Build Your Own Cheat Sheet" project! This project challenges you to create a reference cheat sheet to help you with future web development tasks. Unlike a step-by-step tutorial, this project provides open-ended requirements, allowing you to explore various approaches and solutions. Utilize resources like Codecademy, the internet, and your own notes to successfully complete this project.

Project Goals The primary goal of this project is to build a personalized reference cheat sheet for HTML and CSS. While Codecademy provides excellent learning resources, having your own notes and reference materials can be incredibly valuable for future web development tasks.

Tasks Document at least one HTML or CSS topic. Use HTML tables to display documentation. Implement a custom color scheme. Apply custom styles for code representations.

Contributing Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting issues or pull requests. We welcome improvements and additional topics to enrich the cheat sheet.
